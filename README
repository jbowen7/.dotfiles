This repository is a collection of common hidden files aka 'dotfiles' that I often use.
It includes rcfiles, config files, and other files of that nature, e.g.: .bashrc, pythonrc, etc.

Each file is represented here without its leading period "." so that the files remain
unhidden inside the repo. 

To use, simply create a symbolic/hard link to the file of interest and prepend a "." in the link name.
Usage:
	cd ~/
	git clone git@github.com:jbowen7/.dotfiles.git
	ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
